# GlueX-I Flux

This directory contains a simple bash script that will get the flux for each GlueX-I run period and combine them to have the total GlueX-I flux. The flux is obtained using the ```plot_flux_ccdb.py``` script which can be found in hd_utilities, see [Github](https://github.com/JeffersonLab/hd_utilities/tree/master/psflux)
